# Double pendulum simulation

This is a simulation of double pendulums. There are two versions, one in Python using Pygame, and one in HTML + JavaScript (this was to experiment with using canvas').
They both use the same method to solve the differential equations of equations of motion - the Runge-Kutta method.

## Todo:
- [ ] Create sliders for the values
